    <p1>The Black Keys are an American rock band formed in Akron, Ohio, in 2001
    The group consists of Dan Auerbach (guitar, vocals) and Patrick Carney (drums). 
    The duo began as an independent act, recording music in basements and self-producing their records, 
    before they eventually emerged as one of the most popular garage rock artists during a second wave of the genre's 
    revival in the 2010s. The band's raw blues rock sound draws heavily from Auerbach's blues influences, 
    including Junior Kimbrough, Howlin' Wolf, and Robert Johnson.</p1>
